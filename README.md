# Team-Project-Business-Experiment
* Goal of the Experiment
  * The goal of the experiment was to observe the effect of exposing fashion brands on consumption decisions of
young people who have graduated with the age range of 22 - 27, we decided to conduct the experiment on
graduate students in various institutions. We used the blocking method with the gender of our participants
so we also had to keep in mind the number of participants from each gender.
* Survey Design
  * We designed the survey with Qualtrics platform and utilized the survey logic to create our treatment and
control group and randomization for the participants. Each participant will see a survey with one question
asking about their gender, and 10 questions asking them to choose among 3 fashion items. We divided our
participants into male and female, control and treatment groups, and for those 4 groups, we conducted just
one survey with information questions and 40 fashion brand questions.
